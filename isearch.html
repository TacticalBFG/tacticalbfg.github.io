             <p class="actualshit">The year was 1932, James Chadwick was working in his laboratory
                 with a theory for a new particle in an atom's nucleus, called the neutron.
                He was firing a stream of alpha particles (helium nuclei) at a piece of paraffin wax,
            the same used in candles. When he observed the stream of particles being knocked off, he noticed something
        unsual. There were less charged particles than he expected. Instead, he found that there were uncharged particles that
    had about the same mass as the nucleus being ejected. These were the predictions made by the theory of the neutron, and Chadwick had
just confirmed it. Little did he know, his discovery would pave the way for one of the most destructive bombs the world had ever seen.
Chadwick later remarked "the development of an atomic weapon was not only likely, but inevitable."

<h4 style="padding-left: 0%; margin-top: 0px; font-weight: lighter; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(100,100,100);">The experiment that confirmed the neutron's existance.</h4>

<p class="actualshit">The neutron was the key needed to splitting heavy atomic nuclei. Scientists had tried before with protons, but only saw
    limited success. This was because the nucleus of an atom is positively charged, and firing a charged particle at it will repel eachother. It's similar to
    when you tried to hold the opposite poles of magnets together as a kid, they repelled eachother because they had the same polarity.
    <br><br>
    Leonel Szilard, a hungarian physicist, was the first to predict that a bomb of this power would be capable with the newly discovered neutron.
    There were certain atoms that had a property where they released 2 more neutrons when they split, meaning that the chain reaction grew exponentially.
    He quickly notified Albert Einstein, another physicist at the time, and told him to warn the president about such power.
    At first, even Einstein doubted that it would be possible with the current technologies that humans had, but he later realised that it would be easily
    achievable by a government's funding. He worried that the Germans were working on their own bomb, so eventually wrote a letter to president FDR warning him
    that the Germans might be onto the technology, and sugguested that he create a government program for the development of the bomb.

<p class="actualshit">
    The germans had actually started development of their own atomic bomb. In 1938, Otto Hahn and his assitant, Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission
    of heavy atomic nuclei in their German laboratory. This prompted the Americans to act quickly to 
    start their own research of the atomic bomb.
    <br><br>
    A norwegian spy, Leif Tronstad, also helped warn the Americans about the German's progress on the bomb. He warned them
    that they were building a "Heavy Water Factory" on a Norwegian dam. They did this because heavy water is what its name sugguests,
    water that's heavier. This is because its 2 hydrogen atoms have both a proton and a neutron, compared to the normal single proton in a hydrogen atom.
    They were using this to irradiate plutonium, a fissile element, into something even more destructive.
    <br><br>
    Leif Tronstand and his team later infilrtrated the facility, assisted by the British, planted bombs, and blew it up.
    This brought the German's progress on the bomb to a screeching hault, since they based their entire research around plutonium, and it would be
    too expensive to switch to Uranium.
    <br>
    However, the Americans didn't know that the Germans had stopped their bomb, and were still racing to complete theirs.

    <p class="actualshit">
        Einstein's general theory of relativity greatly assisted with the development of the atomic bomb. His most famous equation, E=MC², gave a relation between
        mass and energy. It said that the energy of any object is equal to its mass times the speed of light squared.
        Because the speed of light squared is so big, it meant that you could pack an insane amount of energy inside a single atom's nucleus.
        If you could somehow liberate all of that energy at once (known in QM as the strong nuclear force), you could easily reach the temperatures of stars.
        <br>
        Einstein wasn't directly involved with the manhattan project, as his pacifist beliefs and celebrity status made him a security risk.

    <p class="actualshit">
        It was only right as the Americans finished completing the bomb that they learned of Germany's failure at creating it.
        This prompted Leonel Szilard, the one who originally warned Einstein of Germany's bomb, to tell the president to not use the bomb.
        Szilard scheduled a meeting with FDR's wife, Elanor Roosevelt, who would pass a letter to FDR. As fate would have it, FDR died right before the meeting, so Szilard never got
        to inform the president of Germany's failure.
        <br><br>
        Because Truman was never notified, Szilard started a petition among the Manhattan Project scientsts to not drop the bomb.
        They had completed the signatures and were about to present it to Truman, when they dropped Little Boy & Fat Man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
        They had tried to save countless innocent Japanese lives, but failed because of FDR's untimely death.
    
        <br><br>
        Einstein later said, "Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing for the bomb."
        Because of the atomb bomb, Einstein quoted one of his most famous sayings,  "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
