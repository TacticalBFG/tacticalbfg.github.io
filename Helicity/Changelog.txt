2/6/20: Pre-Alpha 2.0.4:
  * Improvements to LuaState scanning - much more stable!
  * Can now inject on other games that were crashing before cuz luastate fix
  * Fixed getrawmetatable shutting u down
  * Fixed decompiler crashing - returns constants instead until finished
  * Added back readfile
  * Tightened security on writefile extensions
  * Fixed weird injection issues people were having

1/6/20: Pre-Alpha 2.0.3:
  * Switched to using a bootstrapper for installation
  * Finally added automatic update re-downloading
  * Other small changes

30/5/20: Pre-Alpha 2.0:
 * Completely rewrote Helicity
 * Luau stuff (see b2.0 cuz official beta will just be fixed pre-alph)

??/?/20: Beta 2.0:
 * Update for Roblox
 * After so long, Luau support is finally here! (didnt work on it back in April like I should've, so it was heavily delayed)
Note: some scripts may not fully work for a while because there's still some minor issues with conversion. I provided a way to get around this however (see the bytecode library below)
 * Finally re-did the UI to be cleaner, faster, and easier than before.
 * Helicity uses Roblox's new speed optimizations. Your scripts should execute faster!
 * Improvements to math library:
 	* Added math.log2 (alias math.lb) - returns the binary (base-2) logarithm of arg1.
	* Added math.e - Returns euler's number (the 2.718 dude)
 * New lua syntax!!!
	* Now has native support for bitwise and,or,xor,left shift, and right shift (bitwise NOT needs some tinkering)
	* All the respective tokens for the new syntax can be found in the documentation
	* Ex: print(14 & 3) will do a bitwise AND to 14, and return 2. (since 14 AND 3 is 2)
  * Added support for ++, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ^=; (no -- cuz thats a comment lol)
	* Added the ability to index an array at 0 (really just array[0] will return array[1], more for conveinience.)
 * Improvements to obfuscator:
	* what
 * Added a pretty ok decompiler. (cant decompile large or complex scripts, but should do the job on smaller ones.)
 * Added function getconnections
 * Added function getnamecallmethod
 * Fixed iscclosure
 * Fixed getrenv
 * Fixed getnilinstances
 * Fixed getsenv
 * Added global _WIDTH (gets roblox's screen width, usefor for shortening scripts)
 * Added global _HEIGHT (gets roblox's screen height, useful for shortening scripts)
 * Added debug library:
	* Added function debug.getupvalues
	* Added function debug.setupvalue
	* Added function debug.getaob (see docs)
	* Added function debug.getconstants (see docs)
 * Added some bytecode functions:
	* Added function executebytecode (see docs)
	* Added function getbytecode (see docs)
 * Added clickdetector functions
	* Added function fireclickdetector (see docs)

 * writefile & readfile should be MUCH faster now.
 * Almost every single normal script is now able to be ran on SS without any conversion needed! (see below)
 * Improvements to ss:
	* Supported (most) stuff from the client
	aka: you can now run "print(game.Players.LocalPlayer.Name)", or use RunService, and it'll work. try doing that with skidded sses :flush:
	* Faster execution, like it wasnt fast enough already (jk rerubi fucking slow)
	* Added DataModel::HttpGet to SS
	* Added DataModel::GetObjects to SS
 * Cleaned up Helicity's project, should help improve speed.
 * added herobrine

21/8/19: Beta 1.0.5:
 * Update for Roblox
 * Changed a few things internally to hopefully make it a bit faster

1/8/19: Beta 1.0.1:
 * Update for Roblox
 * Fixed Helicity's awful stability on injection
 * Note: Helicity is a bit broken rn because custom functions crash (working on rewriting callcheck), won't be able to be fixed for a few days because im going camping

 * Replaced some broken SS scripts
 * Fixed saveinstance
 * Fixed Helicity UI not responding 2 seconds after inject (im master coder yes)

 * Temporarily disabled LuaU """""""execution""""""" until I finish actual LuaU proto conversion
 * Changed some stuff internally to make it faster and easier to update.

 * Added debug.getconstants

 * Tried fixing crashing when clicking on Helicity Hub icon in lower left corner
 * Improved security for writefile & readfile

Helicity will have a temporary fix in the coming weeks for this, until I finish the new VM.

 * HelicityHub now allows you to use shortened names
 * Switched LuaState a bit, RemoteSpy/getsenv/getupvalues/getgc/whatever should work fine now.
